`g;` takes you backward one step in the 'changelist'. You can keep `g;`-ing to go to your last edit, the one before that, the one before that, and so on, and you can use `g,` to come back forward in the change list. This is similar to how `;` and `,` work with `f`, `F`, `t`, and `T`.

Also, if you know that you want to go right into insert mode in the place where you last edited (technically, where you last stopped insert mode), you can do `gi`

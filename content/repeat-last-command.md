The last command entered with `:` can be repeated with `@:` and further repeats can be done with `@@`.

Super handy when going through all the matches in an `:Ack` search for example.

So when going through the quickfix list (what Ack displays results in) then instead of typing `:cn` to go through each entry in the list you can just do `@@` after `:@`'ing once.

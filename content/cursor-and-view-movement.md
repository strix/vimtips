`shift + h` - move cursor to top line\
`shift + l` - move cursor to bottom line\
`shift + m` - move cursor to middle line

`zt` - shift view so cursor is on the top line\
`zz` - shift view so cursor is on the middle line\
`zb` - shift view so cursor is on the bottom line

`C-y` and `C-e` to scroll the viewport up and down line by line, keeping the cursor in the same position (similar behavior to `zt`, `zz`, `zb`)

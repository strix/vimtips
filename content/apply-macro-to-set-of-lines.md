Execute the macro stored in register `a` on lines 5 through 10.

```
:5,10norm! @a
```

Execute the macro stored in register `a` on lines 5 through the end of the file.

```
:5,$norm! @a
```

Execute the macro stored in register `a` on all lines.

```
:%norm! @a
```

Execute the macro store in register `a` on all lines matching pattern.

```
:g/pattern/norm! @a
```

To execute the macro on visually selected lines, press `V` and the `j` or `k` until the desired region is selected. Then type `:norm! @a` and observe that the following input line is shown.

```
:'<,'>norm! @a
```

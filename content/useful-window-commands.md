Window commands that I use all the time:

- `<C-w> o` - closes all other windows besides the current one.
- `<C-w> ^` - go to the "alternate file". Very useful for swapping between 2 most recent files.
- `<C-w> T` - if you have a window open in a split and you want to move it to a new tab, focus the window and execute this mapping.
- Remap `<C-w> [h,j,k,l]` to just `<C-[h,j,k,l>` for much easier buffer navigation.
